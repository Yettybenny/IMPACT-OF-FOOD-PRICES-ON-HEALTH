# IMPACT-OF-FOOD-PRICES-ON-HEALTH

## Introduction

Rising food prices are more than just an economic statistic, they have a direct and often devastating impact on public health. 
For many families, especially those in low-income countries, the ability to afford a healthy diet is becoming increasingly out of reach. This case study explores deep into the data behind food prices and health outcomes, showcasing how rising costs influence malnutrition and food security, and providing insights for policymakers to take action.

## Aim

This case study aims to provide a holistic understanding of how food prices influence health and to suggest actionable solutions for enhancing food security and nutrition.

## Objectives

- Examine the affordability of a healthy diet.
- Analyze the prevalence of undernourishment and its correlation with food prices.
- Identify key factors influencing high food prices.
- Understand the health implications of unaffordable diets.
- Provide evidence-based recommendations to policymakers and stakeholders to address high food prices, enhance diet affordability, and improve public health outcomes

## Data Collection

To understand the relationship between food prices and health, data were gathered from multiple reputable sources, including the World Bank, FAO, and UNICEF. The dataset covered a wide range of variables:

— Cost of a healthy diet: A benchmark for assessing how affordable nutritious food is.

— Food price changes: Tracking fluctuations over recent years.

— Population that cannot afford a healthy diet: A key indicator of economic accessibility.

— Prevalence of Undernourishment: The portion of the population suffering from inadequate nutrition.

— Employment distribution: Percentage of the population working in agriculture, industry, and services, to understand the economic context.

***To enhance the analysis, data were incorporated on global hunger and food prices for specific countries, allowing for comparative insights.

## DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION

The data spanned from years(it varies on the provided dataset) 2010-2024, but focus was on 2017-2021 for a clearer view of recent trends and consistency across datasets.
Datasets were merged using common fields (year and country), creating a cohesive dataset that included food prices, affordability, malnutrition, and employment distribution across countries.
Standardization of data types for consistency was done, converting columns like costs and malnutrition rates into numeric formats.
Duplicate entries were removed to ensure accuracy and prevent redundancy in our analysis.
Additional datasets on global hunger and country-specific food prices were added, providing richer context and depth to the analysis.

## ANALYSIS AND KEY INSIGHTS

1. Global Hunger and Effect on Under-5 children

Globally, millions of children under 5 face hunger, causing lifelong health and developmental issues. Nigeria, with high food insecurity, struggles with alarming undernutrition and rising malnutrition rates among young children.

A scroller visual was applied to convey key information, emphasizing the world’s most consumed foods and their nutritional profiles.

2. Cost of a Healthy Diet and Prevalence with Food Prices by Country

Countries like Mali and Burkina-Faso, experience higher costs for healthy diets, significantly impacting food affordability for low-income populations. The high cost is due to various factors, including agricultural limitations, high import dependencies, and currency instability, which drive up prices for both domestic and imported foods.

Countries with persistently high food prices, like Nigeria and Mali, report higher rates of undernourishment. The inability of low-income families to afford nutritious foods results in widespread malnutrition, evidenced by elevated levels of stunting and wasting, especially among children. This connection highlights the urgent need to address food prices to combat undernutrition effectively.

3. Malnutrition and Food Accessibility

A direct relationship was found between rising food prices and malnutrition rates. In countries with low affordability, the rates of undernourishment and malnutrition, including stunting, underweight and wasting among children, were alarmingly high. These trends show the critical link between food cost and access to adequate nutrition.

4. Employment Distribution and Economic Resilience

Countries with diversified employment sectors (industry and services) showed greater resilience to food price spikes. For example, Burundi, with more varied employment opportunities in Agriculture, showed more stability in affordability compared to countries with a high dependence on industry.

5. Comparative Insights

Nigeria experienced the highest volatility in food prices, which strongly correlated with its malnutrition rates.

India saw moderate price changes, but affordability remains a concern due to population size and income disparities.

Cameroon and Mali faced significant challenges in food affordability, affecting large portions of their populations.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

Our findings show the urgent need for action.

1. Implement subsidies for essential, nutritious food items to make a healthy diet more accessible for low-income households.
2. Invest in agricultural innovation and infrastructure to stabilize local food prices and reduce dependency on imported goods.
3. Support the creation of jobs beyond agriculture to provide more stable income sources, enabling families to afford nutritious diets even during economic downturns.
4. Implement Nutrition Education Programs: Promote awareness of affordable, nutritious food options to help communities make healthier choices within their budget.

## CONCLUSION
This case study sheds light on the profound impact of food prices on public health. As food costs continue to rise, families in low-income countries are increasingly unable to afford a healthy diet, leading to higher malnutrition rates and long-term health consequences.

- Addressing this challenge requires coordinated efforts and informed policies to ensure that everyone, regardless of income, has access to nutritious food.

- By dealing with food price issues head-on, governments can improve public health, combat malnutrition, and contribute to a more food-secure world. Let’s work towards a future where the cost of a healthy diet is affordable for all.

- This project serves as both a call to action and a data-backed exploration of a critical global issue. Together, let’s push for policies that make healthy eating accessible to everyone.

## CLOSING THOUGHT

Remember: Food security is not just about producing enough food. It’s about ensuring everyone can afford to eat healthily. Let’s make it possible for every person to have access to nutritious meals, because health should never be a luxury.
